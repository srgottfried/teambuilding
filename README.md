# Teambuilding amusement
## Description
This is a simple template to visualize the difference between **threads**, **processes** and **goroutines** in a controlled environment with a sophisticated *wait a second* system.

## Run
Like a plug-and-plan game, the only thing you need to do is to run the following command:
```bash
./goes.sh
```

## Warning
If your PC doesn't have enough cores, you can fry the processor. **Don't forget the ketchup!**
